# Code-Quiz
Week 4 homework
Create a quiz that includes a timer, high score keeper to include initials, multiple choice answers, and when answered incorrectly the time decreases dramatically.
I created questions with alerts for the answers
Created a variable for the countdown timer
Function for the start of the games as well as coordinating with the timer
Function designating the timer is down to zero and the game is over
Console logs to show the coding 
Added an event listener with click function to enable the correct answer
If the answer is incorrect the timer is depleted by 10 seconds as a penalty for the incorrect answer

This was a VERY difficult homework assignment and is still has issues.
